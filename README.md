## Lessons Learned

    - An incremental approach allowed us to validate the changes we made were good for the health of the code base.
- Git/GitHub Collaboration
    - Branching strategies played a big part in defining the incremental approach.
    - GitHub features like “issues” helped us keep track of future work needs.
    - Established code review process as part of team communication and to maintain quality control.
- Decoupling Code
    - Lots of methods were created in the GameLogic class made it hard to fix bugs later.
    - Decoupling became a major task once the overall flow of the app was working.
